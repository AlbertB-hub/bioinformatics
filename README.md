This git is created with the intention of storing my solutions of the Rosalind.info bioinformatics problems.

All problems have been solved using Python 3.

Each problem has its own folder, which contains the .py scripts and, in most cases, two txts: one for the example input(input.txt or something like that)
and  other .txt with the real dataset with names like rosalind_xxxx.txt.

Some folders may have an extra .py named PRO, Solution PRO or something similar. It's a copy paste of a solution shared by another user in rosalind.info that is much better, efficient and "clean" than the code I reached to develop. I stored it to learn from them. It is not mine.
